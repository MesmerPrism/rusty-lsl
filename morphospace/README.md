# Rusty LSL project workflow

This public, project-local workspace is the control surface for bounded Rusty
LSL iteration. It does not grant runtime authority or indicate compatibility.
The closed feature lock selects no feature or module and has an empty effect
union.

Resume in this order:

1. `project.spec.json`
2. `feature.lock.json`
3. `workspace.state.json`
4. the current iteration unit, if one is named
5. only the event tail and receipts referenced by state

`rlsl-strm-000-compatibility-baseline` is the active documentation-and-
validation unit. Active workflow state permits only the unit's bounded paths
and does not claim protocol implementation, compatibility, oracle measurement,
or runtime activation.
